* Pyramidal cells inspired logic gate notation: Interestingly, the origins of the symbols used in logic can be traced back to an article by [McCulloch and Pitts (1943)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02478259), where pyramidal cells were used in diagrams in a similar fashion to circuit logic today:
